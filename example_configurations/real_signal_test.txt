# In the first line, which is not a comment, is sensors arrangement
# for example if sensors are like the following :
# 	R0 -- 4mm -- R1 -- 11 mm -- R2
# then the following line has to be uncommented : 
4 11
# Then all the next lines represent measurement results
# in this case R0 time, R1 delay, R2 delay, Period of the signal in ms
